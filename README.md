# RadimoicDeepFeatureExtraction

A python implementation for lung tumor deep feature extraction and classification with ResNet-18. With the original ResNet-18 structure, the number of the output of its last fully-connected layer is changed from 1000 to 2 to classify whether a region has a tumor or not. The data sets used in our experiments come from the 2018 IEEE SPS Video and Image Processing (VIP) Cup competition. Please [contact me](mailto:aaron.z.guan@hotmail.com) if you need the training data sets.
